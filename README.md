## 💼 Work Experience

**IT Security Engineer**  
*Omron Software* – Kyoto, Japan  
*March 2021 – July 2024*  
- Served as a core member of the SOC and security operations team, responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents across enterprise systems using EDR and SIEM platforms. Consistently achieved incident triage within 30 minutes, helping minimize operational and business impact.
- Identified inefficiencies in existing threat detection and investigation processes and redesigned incident response workflows, enabling faster root-cause analysis and standardized incident reporting within 30 minutes across teams.
- Led updates to secure development and security operations policies to align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, strengthening organizational maturity across Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions.
- Conducted regular application and infrastructure vulnerability assessments using IBM AppScan and Nessus Professional, translating scan results into prioritized remediation actions based on OWASP Top 10 and CVSS scoring.
- Recognized inconsistencies in threat assessment across group companies and standardized threat evaluation criteria, reducing risk assessment discrepancies by approximately 20% and improving cross-organization security alignment.
- Played a key role in onboarding and operationalizing new security tools in a fast-paced SOC environment, enabling rapid adoption without disruption to ongoing monitoring and response activities.  

**Software Engineer**  
*Staff Service Engineering* – Okayama, Japan  
*July 2019 – February 2021*  
- Developed a home-visit nursing management system using VB.NET and Microsoft SQL Server, supporting clinical operations and data management.
- Collaborated with a 6-member development team, delivering features on schedule without project delays.
